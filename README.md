# Encrypted_message
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Romeo and Juliet love each other. Romeo wants to send a message to Juliet and also doesn't want anyone to read it without his permission. So he shifted every small letter in the sentence by the -2 position and every capital letter by the -3 position. (If the letter is c, after shifting to by -2 position it changes to a, and for D new letter will be A).
But the letter is too long and Romeo does not have enough time to encrypt his whole letter. Write a program to help Romeo which prints the encrypted message. You can assume there are no special characters except spaces and numeric values.

## Input
A string S 

## Output 
Encrypted string 

## Example

## Input
Hello Juliet

## Output
Ecjjm Gsjgcr

## Explanation
H is shifted by -3 position and changed to E. 'e' is shifted by -2 position and changed to c and so on.
